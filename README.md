# Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm

A C++ program to find the shortest path in a 2D grid using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Overview

This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a 2D grid. It utilizes a priority queue to efficiently explore and prioritize paths based on their accumulated costs.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** The program applies Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path in a given 2D grid.
- **Priority Queue:** A priority queue is used to efficiently explore paths, ensuring that shorter paths are explored first.

## Usage

To run the program, compile and execute it with the necessary input parameters. The program will output the minimum cost and the path from the start to the end.

```bash
./shortest_path_dijkstra
```
